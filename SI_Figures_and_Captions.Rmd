# Simulations

##  Simulation Setup Example
  
![Example illustration of the simulation model grid and impact of directional change in the values of an environmental variable. Values are drawn from the same simulation as illustrated in the main text Figure 2.  Values from the peripheral nodes not used for the JSDM fitting are shown greyed out. a) Initial distribution of $E_1$. b) Distribution of $E_2$. c) Growth rate $R$, of an example species before the onset of climate change. Note the approximately circular shape, but the high degree of heterogeneity. d) Growth rate R of the example species after 25 time steps of climate change ($t=25$). Note the leftwards shift in the optimal (bright colours) habitat.  e) Pre-climate change distribution of an example species. Note the approximate correspondence with the growth rates, but also infilling due to dispersal mass-effects f) Mid-climate change distribution of the example species. Note the movement lags - the shift leftwards movement is not as noticeable as in the growth rates (d).](SimulationMarkdowns/Figures/SimulationExample.png){height=50%}

## Impact of parameters on metacommunity size and occupancy


![Impact of simulation model parameters on key metacommunity statistics prior to the  introduction of environmental change. Only species that are used in the JSDMs are included here, i.e. excluding those that are too rare (or abundant) within the focal squares. Each facet includes all 2460 simulations, but are separated by different responses and driving parameters. Boxplots hinges show 25 and 75th percentiles.](SimulationMarkdowns/Figures/OccuBefore.png)


## Impact of parameters on simulated metacommunity structure

![Impact of the model parameters on the simulated metacommunity structure, as assessed by variance partitioning before the introduction of environmental change. Boxplots hinges show 25 and 75th percentiles. ](SimulationMarkdowns/Figures/ParamStart.png)

## Impact of parameters on shift in simulated metacommunity structure

![The dependence of shifts in the variance partitioning on the parameters of the simulated metacommunities. Figure 3 in the main text is a summary of this plot. Boxplots hinges show 25 and 75th percentiles. ](SimulationMarkdowns/Figures/ParamShift.png)


## Impact of false absences on detectability of shift in metacommunity structure


![Impact of false absences on the consistent identity of trends.  Simulation was run as with the analysis in the main text, but with a reduced spread of core model parameters ($\delta$: $10^{-5}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-3}$;  $\alpha$; $0.3, 0.8, 1.1$, $\gamma$: $5, 20, 40$, $\sigma$: $10^{-3}, 10^{-2}, 10^{-1}$), crossed with 4 levels of false absences ($0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2$). False absences are introduced by randomly, and independently, switching each presence (i.e. above threshold) to an absence with a given probability. Boxplots hinges show 25 and 75th percentiles. ](SimulationMarkdowns/Figures/FalseAbs.png) 



# Butterfly Dataset


## Distribution of Sites

![Distribution of UKBMS transect sites with sufficient data over focal period to be included in the analysis.](ButterflyMarkdowns/ButterflySIFigs/ButterflySiteMaps.png)

## Occupancy Through Time

![Total occupancy (i.e. total species:site presence records out of maximum possible) of focal butterfly species in focal sites across the time period. ](ButterflyMarkdowns/ButterflySIFigs/TotalOccupancy.png)


## Species-Level Responses

![Species-level variance partitioning and species occupancy fraction (out of the 97 focal sites) through time.  Note that the changes in the overall variance partitioning are driven by changes in relatively few of the species. However, these species (for example Common Blue and Green Hairstreak) are not necessarily those that are notably changing occupancy through this period.](ButterflyMarkdowns/ButterflySIFigs/SpeciesResponses.png)

## Fitted Species Associations

Note the grouping into a large cluster dominated by chalk grassland species and a smaller cluster of species associated with woodlands.](ButterflyMarkdowns/ButterflySIFigs/SpAssCoeffs.png){height=80%}

## Confirming Model Convergence



![Histogram of Gelman-Rubin MCMC convergence statistics across all years of the butterfly dataset based on two independent chains  fit for each year of the full model (total iterations = 100000, burn-in = 50000, and thinning = 50)  a) Main effect coefficients (i.e. environmental and spatial coefficients) are all well below the standard threshold of 1.1, indicating acceptable convergence. b) Equivalent results for the species codistribution fitting are by necessity slightly more derived, as they are fit by latent variables that might not necessarily be fit in the same order, even if they converge. We therefore examine the convergence in the elements of the correlation matrix $\Omega$. Here the vast majority are well converged, although there are a few correlations that exceeded 1.2. However, as these were very much a minority and were not signifcantly over (the maximum was 1.29), we considered these models suitable converged.  ](ButterflyMarkdowns/ButterflySIFigs/ButterflyConvergence_GR.png)

# Birds

## Distribution of Sites

![Location of the hectads retained from the British Breeding Bird Atlas dataset. Boundaries (51째 : 54.3째 latitude, -2.3째 : -0.9째 longitude) were chosen to be a simple shape that excludes coastal regions. The slight shoulder is due to the non-exact alignment between the UK National Grid and lines of longitude. ](BirdMarkdowns/BirdImages/HectadLocations.png)

Largest value was 1.069. b) Elements of the correlation matrix ($\Omega$). Largest value was 1.102.   All were well below the standard thresholds indicating convergence is likely achieved. ](BirdMarkdowns/BirdImages/ModelCovergence.png)
